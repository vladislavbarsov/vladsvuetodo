# vladsvuetodo

## Project setup

A simple Todo app using VueJS and Bootstrap for styling.

My goal was to implement all the gained knowledge of VueJS such as:

* Vuex
* Props
* Event Bus
* Global Event Bus

And to try and implement the following:

* Simple Animation
* Mobile friendly using Bootstrap 3
* Local Storage
* Long Press Directive

And all of this to be pushed to Github using the Github for Desktop app.
